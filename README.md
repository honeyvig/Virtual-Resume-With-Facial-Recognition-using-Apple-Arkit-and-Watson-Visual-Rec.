# Virtual-Resume-With-Facial-Recognition-using-Apple-Arkit-and-Watson-Visual-Rec.
Creating a Virtual Resume with facial recognition using Apple ARKit and IBM Watson Visual Recognition involves combining several components of AR, facial recognition, and machine learning. Below is an outline of the basic steps and code snippets needed to build this project. Please note that you need to set up an IBM Watson account and access the Watson Visual Recognition API, and integrate it into your project.
Prerequisites

    Apple Developer Account
    IBM Watson API Key and URL
    Xcode (for iOS development)
    Swift programming language

Steps:

    Create an ARKit-based App
    Youâ€™ll need to set up an ARKit-based app that uses the front camera to capture the user's face.

    Set up Watson Visual Recognition
    Sign up on IBM Watson, get API credentials, and create a custom model for face recognition (or use pre-trained models).

    Integrating ARKit for Virtual Resume
    Use ARKit to place the virtual resume in the AR environment.

    Use Facial Recognition for Authentication
    Capture the user's face with ARKit's camera and pass the image to Watson Visual Recognition to identify or verify the person.

Code Outline:

    Setting Up ARKit to Capture Faces First, create an ARSession using ARKit to start capturing facial data.

import UIKit
import SceneKit
import ARKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, ARSessionDelegate {
    
    @IBOutlet var sceneView: ARSCNView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Setup ARSession for face tracking
        let configuration = ARFaceTrackingConfiguration()
        sceneView.session.run(configuration)
        
        sceneView.session.delegate = self
    }
    
    // Optional: Handle AR face tracking data (You can adjust the virtual objects based on the face position)
    func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate anchors: [ARAnchor]) {
        for anchor in anchors {
            if let faceAnchor = anchor as? ARFaceAnchor {
                // Use faceAnchor for face data
            }
        }
    }
}

    Add Facial Image for Watson Recognition Once a face is captured from ARKit, extract the image and send it to Watson Visual Recognition. First, you need to set up the WatsonSDK by adding the IBM Watson SDK to your Xcode project.

    Example of calling Watson API:

import UIKit
import WatsonDeveloperCloud
import ARKit

class ViewController: UIViewController, ARSessionDelegate {

    let visualRecognition = VisualRecognition(version: "2018-03-19", apiKey: "YOUR_WATSON_API_KEY")
    
    @IBOutlet var sceneView: ARSCNView!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // ARKit Setup
        let configuration = ARFaceTrackingConfiguration()
        sceneView.session.run(configuration)
        sceneView.session.delegate = self
    }
    
    func session(_ session: ARSession, didUpdate anchors: [ARAnchor]) {
        for anchor in anchors {
            if let faceAnchor = anchor as? ARFaceAnchor {
                let faceImage = getFaceImage(from: faceAnchor)
                recognizeFace(faceImage)
            }
        }
    }
    
    func getFaceImage(from faceAnchor: ARFaceAnchor) -> UIImage {
        // Convert ARFaceAnchor data to image (you need custom code to extract image from ARKit)
        return UIImage(named: "sampleFaceImage")!  // Placeholder for extracted image
    }
    
    func recognizeFace(_ image: UIImage) {
        let imageData = image.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8)!
        
        let parameters = VisualRecognition.ModelType.custom("your_custom_model_id")
        visualRecognition.classify(image: imageData, parameters: parameters) { response, error in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error during classification: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            } else {
                // Process Watson's response
                print(response?.result ?? "No result from Watson")
                displayVirtualResume()
            }
        }
    }
    
    func displayVirtualResume() {
        // Show a virtual resume in AR (this is just an example to place a 3D object)
        let textNode = SCNNode()
        textNode.geometry = SCNText(string: "John Doe\nSoftware Engineer", extrusionDepth: 1.0)
        textNode.position = SCNVector3(0, 0, -0.1) // Adjust placement
        sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(textNode)
    }
}

Key Steps to Implement:

    Extract Face Data: ARKit's ARFaceAnchor can provide face data like position, blend shapes, and more. However, to send an actual image to Watson, you'll need to capture a photo from the AR camera. You can use ARFrame to get the current camera image.

    Watson Integration: Use Watson's Visual Recognition API to process the image and match the face with a pre-trained model. You can use Watson's pre-trained face recognition model or create your own custom model.

    Display the Virtual Resume: Once the face is successfully recognized, you can display a virtual resume in the AR space. The SCNText node is used to show text in 3D space, and you can adjust this to display detailed information.

Notes:

    Ensure the app requests camera access and privacy permissions.
    Depending on your model, Watson may return confidence scores for the recognized face, and you can conditionally display the resume based on that.
    The model used with Watson Visual Recognition will need to be trained on images of faces, which could be your own model or IBM's general model.

Final Thoughts:

This is a basic structure to get started with ARKit and Watson for facial recognition. There are additional details, such as handling different facial angles, improving AR placement, or optimizing the machine learning model, that you'll need to refine based on your specific needs.
